# Open Polytechnic Technical Test - Junior Level

For this test you will be required to add to an existing application based on the problem statement below. The application has an Angular front-end, and a C#/.NET back-end. You should not need to touch the client and it exist only to make for an easy and (hopefully) visually appealing way to use a REST API and display the results.

While adding to the back-end, note that the code could do with some improvement. Part of this exercise is not only to add your new functionality, but to leave the codebase in a better state than which you found it.

-----------------------------------------

Y'Shtola and Fen run a small cafe together. They have a standard menu and a smaller menu they run on the weekend. They provide a range of discounts for children, students, and senior citizens. However, they also have a surcharge for non-children ordering from the children's menu.

Fen also runs a catering side business from the cafe, and piggybacks off their site to present the menu and take orders. However, at the moment, all items on the catering menu will be subject to the same discounts that apply for the standard and weekend menus. Fen doesn't want her catering menu to be discounted.

You are tasked with making sure that Fen can take orders for her catering menu without incurring a loss, while also not breaking any of the existing functionality for the two cafe menus and the ordering system.

You will not be required to write unit tests for this exercise, but you should think about how you would implement them while designing your solution. You will be asked about this during the interview.
